## Concept Art
In this assignment, I tried to replicate the townhouses in Amsterdam. I enjoyed how skinny they are and how easily diverse the townhouses can be.

## Overview
For this project, I followed the tutorial and created these townhouses.

For the windows, you can set how many panes are in each window. For the door, you can set the height of the door window. And for the balcony, you can set the railing details (rows and columns).

Following the tutorial, each door is connected to a balcony, but no balconies are on the first floor. To get the townhouses to look more similar to my concept art, I got rid of the balconies and just added 3 windows on each floor above the ground floor.

I also followed the tutorial to add the pillars, supports, and borders.

Since I am newer to Houdini, I stuck to be pretty close to the tutorial (and wasn't able to figure out roofs). Given the circumstances and my own lack of knowledge though, I feel like the townhouses turned out pretty well.

I will also be using 2 late days on this assignment!
